# It was great

Jeremy Howard, Sylvain Gugger, and whomever else contributed... Thank you!

Your courses up till this point have been more than the deep learning community could have ever asked for. Ive been following ever since fastai course v2, and shit. You have improved immensely. 

Even through the battle we are all having with covid, Jeremy managed to deliver a coherent, simple, and easy-to-follow learning experience that I think absolutely anyone can do. No matter their background. 

This is the kind of thing that deep learning researchers have been talking about for a long time. We need to democratize AI, get it in the hands of everybody. Your course and library acheives that without hampering the ability to do more and go farther. Which is exactly what I'm planning on doing.

I will say, though. I think the course started out a little slower than the previous one, course V3. Which I dont mind, frankly.

I want to express how much I admire Jeremy for putting himself out there. The world needs more people who are willing to make videos themselves spouting their own knowlege. The reason people dont is due to the inherent state of vulnerability which doing such a thing puts us in. It leaves us out in the open to be critisized. Maybe all we have learned or been taught was wrong? 

On the bright side, if your knowlege base is critisized, one would learn from such experiences, and they will grow. So long as their ego can take the punishment, that is.

Anyways, this is not a review or anything. Just some mind vomit. Thanks for the course and library fastai!
